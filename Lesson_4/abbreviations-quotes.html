	<p>Martin Luther King, Jr. once said <q>I have a Dream</q></p>

		<p> I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
        Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.
