			<p>This is the body section of our blog post. In this section i will write about things. I'll sure to use <abbr title="Hyper text markup language">HTML</abbr> tags that  i have been learning for a while on how to code. </p>

			<p>This is <span class="danger-text">another paragraph</span> and i would like to quote that Martin Luther King once said <q>I have a Dream.</q></p>

			<blockquote cite="http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1951-/martin-luther-kings-i-have-a-dream-speech-august-28-1963.php">
				<p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</p>

				<p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.</p>
