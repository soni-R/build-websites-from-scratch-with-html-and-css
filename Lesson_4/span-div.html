        div is a block level element, span is inline element.
        The span and div tags apply no meaning at all, but they are actually used extensively in conjunction with CSS.
        
        The difference between span and div is that a span element is used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div element used to group larger chunks of code.
